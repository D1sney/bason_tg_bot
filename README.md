# Bason Telegram Bot ü§ñ

Bason is a Telegram bot designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking details (parts) across multiple specialized chats:

- **Manager Chat:** Initiates requests (e.g., checking availability, requesting items).
- **Warehouse Chat:** Confirms availability and forwards items to the next stage or marks them as lost.
- **Issuance Chat:** Marks items as sold or returns them to the warehouse.
- **Sold Chat:** Collects all sold items.
- **Lost Chat:** Collects all lost or missing items.

This structure helps automate the workflow of requesting, approving, and tracking parts within an organization.

## Features

- **Multi-Chat Integration:**  
  The bot routes messages and actions among various Telegram chats, each handling a specific part of the workflow.

- **Availability Checks:**  
  Warehouse operators can confirm or deny the availability of requested parts.

- **Issuance and Sales Tracking:**  
  Issued parts can be marked as sold or returned to the warehouse, and all sold parts are automatically collected in a dedicated chat.

- **Lost Parts Management:**  
  Missing or unavailable parts are automatically noted in a separate ‚Äúlost‚Äù chat for further action.

- **Simple and Extensible:**  
  The bot‚Äôs logic is built on top of the [Aiogram](https://docs.aiogram.dev/) framework, making it easy to extend and maintain.
